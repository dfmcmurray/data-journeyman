title: "Numeric Calculation Workflow"
blurb: "A Data Scientist is often concerned with optimization problems, so when I find a great workflow for getting a task done efficiently, I immediately want to incorporate it into my process."

I recently added a 12.9" iPad Pro to my Apple family of products. My only previous iPad was an iPad mini, and I didn't use it nearly enough to warrant that purchase. However, I had hopes that the larger form factor – in conjunction with the added capabilities like the Apple Pencil – would give this new device a lasting place in my overall computing device usage. I'm happy to say that this is definitely the case, and I find myself using my iPad Pro more and more often for various parts of my workflow. (I'm even writing this blog post on it using the [Working Copy](http://workingcopyapp.com) app.) 

Yesterday, I was working on a series of numerical calculations for an [A/B Testing class](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257) I'm taking, and I found a great workflow that allowed me to get through a lot of complex numerical calculations without losing place in a web of calculations.

Using iOS's multitasking feature, I had the Notes app running side by side with a great handwriting calculator called [MyScript Calculator](http://www.myscript.com/calculator/). With this setup, I was able to keep my long-running calculations in the Notes app and then seamlessly do actual calculations on the calculator's scratch pad, which would evaluate whatever expression I scribbled on it.

I like this workflow because it feels so natural, and I hope that in the coming generation of computing devices there are more and more ways to make our tools natural extensions of our process to better facilitate fast and effective workflows.
