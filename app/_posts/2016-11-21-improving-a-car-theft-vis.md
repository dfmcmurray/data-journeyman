I receive data visualizations every day in my email inbox from [Statista](https://www.statista.com), and they range from insightful to comical, but they're very often thought provoking. I received one the other day that definitely provoked some thought from me, though it caused me to wonder if there was room for improvement.

This [visualization about car theft in America](https://www.statista.com/chart/6551/the-10-most-stolen-cars-in-america/), while very interesting, shows the thefts in absolute numbers. Part of the takeaway of such a visualization is going to be how safe these cars are in terms of theft deterrent. However, it's the case that if a certain car is much more popular, then it will be stolen more even if it has the same rate of theft as another less popular car. 

To improve this visualization, I would have shown thefts as a percentage of the number of cars that are registered of each model. To show this, it would be helpful to have a complete record of all registered cars in the U.S. I wasn't able to find such a database, but I did find reports on historical car sales, which are a good estimate. [According to an Auto-Blog article](http://www.autoblog.com/photos/historys-10-bestselling-cars-of-all-time/#slide-1002357), the all-time best selling cars in America are 

1. Toyota Corrola
2. Ford F-Series
3. Volkswagen Golf
4. Volkswagen Beetle
5. Ford Escort
6. Honda Civic
7. Honda Accord
8. Ford Model T
9. Volkswagen Passat
10. Chevrolet Impala

If the sales numbers were included in the theft chart as a normalization factor, then the rankings would probably be different, and in the case that someone uses that information to decide which car is safer, that's vital information to include.
