###Visualization Recap

[Post 1: Data Visualization]()

In the first post on visualization, I showed how the visual system dominates over the other input senses in terms of bandwidth. This extraordinary processing power is what enables the main topic of this post, [preattentive processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-attentive_processing)g. Since the brain's ability to process visual information is so great, much of it happens outside of the slower mechanism of attention.

[Post 2: Visual Encodings]()

In the second post on visualization, the paper I cited by Cleveland and McGill tests each visual encoding's effectiveness by measuring preattentive processing, or as the authors put it, the "instantaneous perception of the visual field that comes without apparent mental effort." This stage of preattentive processing affected the overall accuracy of the viewer when judging value changes across various visual encodings.

[Post 3: Color]()
Color, with its ability to highlight pertinent information, is an excellent tool for triggering preattentive processing of salient data. In [the words of Maureen Stone](https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/b-eye/choosing_colors.pdf), "Contrasting colors are different, analogous colors are similar. Contrast draws attention, analogy groups." As we'll see in this post, this effect of grouping and separating items based on color happens at the preattentive stage.

###Preattentive Processing

To take advantage of the huge bandwidth of the visual system, you must convey information to the viewer at the preattentive level, because preattentive processing is parallel, whereas attentive processing (the conscious part of perception) is serial. Stephen Few goes into this process in his article [Tapping the Power of Visual Perception](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/visual_perception.pdf), from which I will borrow several examples.

Take the following example to illustrate this point. Assume the most salient information in this visual is the number of fives present. In the top box, all of the numbers are the same color, and no preattentive processing occurs. In the second box, the fives have a different color value, and are therefore trivially easy for the viewer to pick out and count.

It's important to note that preattentive processing is only effective if it's used to emphasize the salient information. If the most important thing for the viewer to see is the number of sixes in the visualization, then there is no advantage from preattentive processing in either box.

The following diagram (adapted from Alan D. Baddeley's [The Psychology of Memory](http://media.johnwiley.com.au/product_data/excerpt/1X/04700914/047009141X.pdf)) demonstrates where preattentive processing occurs on the memory pipeline.

A good example of taking advantage of preattentive processing in data visualation can be found in [this post](http://www.storytellingwithdata.com/blog/2011/10/google-example-preattentive-attributes) on the *Storytelling with Data* blog.
