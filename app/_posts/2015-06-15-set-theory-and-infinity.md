###Khan Academy's Talent Search

To start off, I owe you an explanation why I didn't have a post last week, and why this post deviates from our usual discussion.

Many people say that data science is the intersection of programming, statistics, and domain expertise. For me, I want that domain to be education â€“ I've always had a passion for it. There's a lot in the U.S. education system that could be improved upon, and I think the techniques of data science can help improve it.

So, when I stumbled upon the [Khan Academy Talent Search](https://www.khanacademy.org/talentsearch), I knew I had to make a submission. The contest allowed me to stretch my educational muscles again by creating two 10 minute videos on anything subject I wanted. 

Immediately, I thought back to a mathematical proof by [Georg Cantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Georg_Cantor) that showed that infinities could have different magnitudes. It was one of several mathematical revelations I was introduced to in high school that really got me excited about math in a way that I hadn't gotten from my high school classes.

So, instead of a full blog post this week, I'm just going to link to the two videos I created that lead up to this amazing argument by Cantor, his diagonal argument. The first video is a general introduction to set theory, and gives you everything you need for the second video, which lays out the idea that infinite sets can have different sizes.

2. [Infinite Sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQgEzF2a0_I)

In data science, we wouldn't get very far without sets of data, and while grinding away on practical problems is fun and extemely useful, a good perspective of the theoretical will only enrich your understanding.
