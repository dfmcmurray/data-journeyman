The frequency of my posts has diminished recently, and for the next year or so I'm going to try to make two posts per months instead of one per week. The reason for this is that I've enrolled in [Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). My personal study, including the work I've done for this blog, have been great at propelling me into the world of data science, but I've decided that a more formalized structure will be even more beneficial to that path. 

The Udacity program is all online and it consists of roughly 10-hour weeks for 9 to 12 months. I've written about [some of their ideas](http://www.datajourneyman.com/2014/11/13/why-data-science-will-power-the-future.html) before, and I really like their approach to education. Also, at the end of the program, I'll have a portfolio of projects that will better position me to meet my overall goal that I laid out in [my very first post](http://www.datajourneyman.com/2014/08/28/data-journeyman.html), to break into the world of data science.

But I still truly value the excursions into the world of data that this blog allows me to explore, so I will continue with the usual posts, just less often. Next up in the Curriculum posts, I will dig into [Think Bayes](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/), by the same author as the _Think Stats_ book that we've already covered. And I will continue to point out poor data usage in my Ice Cream Crimes posts. I'm sure that some of the Nanodegree's influence will seep over into my posts, too, only to make them all that much better and representative of the data science field.

Thanks for coming along with me this far, and I hope you'll join me on the next phase of the journey.
