I couldn&#39;t quite grasp how such a thing could be true. I must have been an arrogant teenager to think that my slight unease over this surprising idea trumped the countless smart, qualified statisticians&#39; acceptance of it.</p><p>The important distinction here that helped me over the skeptical hump is that we&#39;re not fixing a date, and then comparing 23 people&#39;s birthdays to it. Instead, we&#39;re looking at each pair of people individually, so the actual date of the shared birthday is not fixed.</p><p>This post explores the nuances of this paradox. For simplicity, the remainder of this post will ignore Leap Day (February 29) birthdays. And it will also assume that each birth date is equally likely, which in reality <a href=http://gawker.com/5910778/infographic-illustrates-most-common-birthdays-baby-making-days>is not the case</a>.</p><h3>Testing This With Data</h3><p>If only I had had IPython as a teenager, I would have been able to convince myself much more quickly that the birthday paradox is true.</p><p>Download the IPython Notebook for this post <a href=/ipython-notebooks/Birthday%20Paradox.ipynb>here</a>.</p><h3>Beyond Soccer Teams</h3><p>When we originally stated the problem, we used a soccer team of 23 players. But what happens if you allow that number to vary? What is the probability of a group of 10 people having a pair of matching birthdays? What about 30? 50? 100? 1000?</p><p>Well, the problem is easy to solve if there are 366 people. Based on the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle>pigeonhole principle</a>, at least two people <em>must</em> share a birthday, so the probability is 1. Similarly, it&#39;s easy to solve for a group of 1. The probability would be 0.</p><p>So, what about groups of size 2 to 365?</p><p>One option here is to calculate each probability by hand like we did above for 23 people, but that would be agonizing. Another option would be to construct an equation, which would the most correct thing to do, but that seems tedious when compared to our third option: run some trials and let the data do the work for us.</p><p><img src=/img/birthday-problem-group-size.753c.png alt="Birthday Problem On Different Group Sizes"></p><p>We can tell a lot looking at this graph. A group of 2 has a next-to-zero chance of a match. At 40 people, the probability rises to over 80%. Then at 60 people, the probability is all but 100%. We could get even more precise information by printing out the actual calculated probabilities for each group size.</p><p>After writing a quick program and letting my computer grind on it for about 5 minutes, I came up with that beauty of a graph, and I barely even had to lift a finger. Thanks, computer!</p><p><img src=/img/bender-high-five.64ef.gif alt="Bender High Five"></p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>This was great fun and all, but is there any practical application of what we&#39;ve seen in this post? Actually, there is a cryptographic attack call the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack>Birthday Attack</a> named for the statistical properties of the Birthday Paradox.</p><p>There are a few differences, of course. The main one being that we&#39;re not looking for matching birthdays (of which, in our simplified example, there are only 365 possibilities), but instead we&#39;re looking for matching outputs of a hash function, which would be a <em>much</em> larger space than just 365 possibilities. But the basic principles are the same, and you know everything you need in order to understand the gist of it.</p><p>Particularly interesting is the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack#Digital_signature_susceptibility>application of this attack on Digital Signatures</a>.</p></div><div class=comments><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>/* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT BEFORE PASTING INTO YOUR WEBPAGE * * */
