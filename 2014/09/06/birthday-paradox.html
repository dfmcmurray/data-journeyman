I couldn&#39;t quite grasp how such a thing could be true. I must have been an arrogant teenager to think that my slight unease over this surprising idea trumped the countless smart, qualified statisticians&#39; acceptance of it.</p><p>The important distinction here that helped me over the skeptical hump is that we&#39;re not fixing a date, and then comparing 23 people&#39;s birthdays to it. Instead, we&#39;re looking at each pair of people individually, so the actual date of the shared birthday is not fixed.</p><p>This post explores the nuances of this paradox. For simplicity, the remainder of this post will ignore Leap Day (February 29) birthdays. And it will also assume that each birth date is equally likely, which in reality <a href=http://gawker.com/5910778/infographic-illustrates-most-common-birthdays-baby-making-days>is not the case</a>.</p><h3>Testing This With Data</h3><p>If only I had had IPython as a teenager, I would have been able to convince myself much more quickly that the birthday paradox is true.</p><p>Download the IPython Notebook for this post <a href=/ipython-notebooks/Birthday%20Paradox.ipynb>here</a>.</p><h3>Guessing a Birthday</h3><p>Just like you (and my teenage intuition) would expect, the probability of guessing a birthday out of a group of 23 is \(23/365\), or \(0.06301\). But this assumes that no one in the group shares a birthday, which, as the paradox states, is over a 50% chance. It would get very complicated to calculate the probability this way.</p><p>\[\dfrac{23}{365} \times P(\text{ no shared birthdays }) + \goodbreak \dfrac{22}{365} \times P(\text{ 2 shared birthdays }) + \goodbreak \dfrac{21}{365} \times P(\text{ 3 shared birthdays }) + \ldots\]</p><p>So a better way to find the probability of guessing a birthday from a group would be to subtract the probability of <em>not</em> guessing a correct birthday from 1. Not guessing a correct birthday would be the equivalent of tossing an extremely biased coin 23 times, or \((364/365)^{23}\), so the probability of guessing a correct birthday is \(1 - (364/365)^{23}\), or \(0.06115\). This calculation takes into account the possibility of matching birthdays in the group, whereas the \(0.06301\) calculation does not.</p><p>If you&#39;re still feeling skeptical, then we can generate trials and test this out with the power of data. First, generate a list of 23 integers between 0 and 364 (inclusive), each integer value representing a date of the year.</p><p>\[ \begin{array} 133, 191, 212, 68, 133, 148, 164, 82,\\ 192, 172, 22, 352, 13, 196, 86, 335,\\ 308, 87, 355, 51, 291, 11, 353 \end{array} \]</p><p>Now we can run trials where we generate a random number (our guess) and see if it matches any birthdays in the list. The more trials we run, the closer we should get to the above probability. The following graph shows the convergence of the computer probability over a growing number of guesses.</p><p><img src=/img/guessing-birthdays.ff55.png alt="Guessing Birthdays Graph"></p><p>One thing you&#39;ll notice about the above graph is that is converges just over 6% instead of 6.3% like we calculated earlier for guessing from a group of 23 fixed birthdays. Why is that?</p><p>Well, look closely at the list of birthdays and you&#39;ll notice that the value 133 is present twice. After all, since we generated these numbers randomly, the birthday paradox states that there was over a 50% that there would be a duplicate. So really we were guessing out of a group of 22 distinct birthdays, and \(22/365 = 0.06027\), which is just over 6%.</p><p>If we generated a new list of birthdays, and there were no duplicates, then we could run the trials again and it should converge on 6.3%.</p><p>Does it feel like a party yet?</p><p><img src=/img/having-fun-yet.94ab.gif alt="Are we having fun yet?"></p><h3>Pairs of Teammates</h3><p>The actual problem to solve with the birthday paradox, though, is not the probability of guessing a correct birthday, but the probability that at least two people in the group share a birthday.</p><p>Again, finding this probability is more easily done but first finding the probability that no one in the group shares a birthday. Let&#39;s take each person in the group one by one. The first person can have any birthday, so the probability that his/her birthday doesn&#39;t violate the assumption that no one shares a birthday is 1. The second person can have any birthday except for the first person&#39;s, so that probability is 364/365. The third person can have any birthday that doesn&#39;t match the first or second person&#39;s birthday (which aren&#39;t the same in this scenario), so the probability is 363/365. And so on.</p><p>\[ \begin{eqnarray} &amp;P&amp;(\text{ no shared birthdays }) \\ &amp;=&amp; \dfrac{365}{365} \times \dfrac{364}{365} \times \dfrac{363}{365} \times \ldots \times \dfrac{343}{365}\\ &amp;=&amp; 0.4927 \end{eqnarray} \]</p><p>The only other option from having no shared birthdays is to have a least one pair of shared birthdays, i.e., at least two shared birthdays.</p><p>\[ \begin{eqnarray} &amp;P&amp;(\text{ at least 2 shared birthdays })\\ &amp;=&amp; 1 - P(\text{ no shared birthdays })\\ &amp;=&amp; 0.5073 \end{eqnarray} \]</p><p>So, that demonstrates that there is over a 50% chance of two players sharing a birthday. Now, lets run some trials just to assuage our lingering skepticism.</p><p>For these trials, we&#39;ll generate a list of groups, where each group consists of 23 birthdays. We will increase the number of groups we consider and put that sample size on the x axis. Then we&#39;ll run through all of the groups to determine how many groups have at least one pair of matching birthdays. We will plot that percentage on the y axis.</p><p><img src=/img/birthday-problem.50e3.png alt="Birthday Problem"></p><p>The range of percentages on the entire graph is only about 3 percentage points, but it&#39;s still clear that as the sample sizes increase, the probability starts converging between 50 and 51 percent, which is in line with our calculations above.</p><h3>Beyond Soccer Teams</h3><p>When we originally stated the problem, we used a soccer team of 23 players. But what happens if you allow that number to vary? What is the probability of a group of 10 people having a pair of matching birthdays? What about 30? 50? 100? 1000?</p><p>Well, the problem is easy to solve if there are 366 people. Based on the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle>pigeonhole principle</a>, at least two people <em>must</em> share a birthday, so the probability is 1. Similarly, it&#39;s easy to solve for a group of 1. The probability would be 0.</p><p>So, what about groups of size 2 to 365?</p><p>One option here is to calculate each probability by hand like we did above for 23 people, but that would be agonizing. Another option would be to construct an equation, which would the most correct thing to do, but that seems tedious when compared to our third option: run some trials and let the data do the work for us.</p><p><img src=/img/birthday-problem-group-size.753c.png alt="Birthday Problem On Different Group Sizes"></p><p>We can tell a lot looking at this graph. A group of 2 has a next-to-zero chance of a match. At 40 people, the probability rises to over 80%. Then at 60 people, the probability is all but 100%. We could get even more precise information by printing out the actual calculated probabilities for each group size.</p><p>After writing a quick program and letting my computer grind on it for about 5 minutes, I came up with that beauty of a graph, and I barely even had to lift a finger. Thanks, computer!</p><p><img src=/img/bender-high-five.64ef.gif alt="Bender High Five"></p><h3>N Matching Birthdays</h3><p>So far, we&#39;ve only looked at the probability of a group having at least 2 matching birthdays. What about the probability of having exactly 2 matching birthdays? Or exactly 5? Or everyone having a matching birthday? It&#39;s not hard to modify our computations to generalize that piece of that problem.</p><p>Let&#39;s fix the group size to 23 people again. If we run a million trials to see how many birthday matches we get on a group of 23, we get the following results.</p><p><img src=/img/n-matching-birthdays.d2d6.png alt="Occurences of N Matching Birthdays in a Group of 23"></p><p>\[ \begin{eqnarray} N = 0 &amp;:&amp; 493304\\ N = 2 &amp;:&amp; 362554\\ N = 3 &amp;:&amp; 7316\\ N = 4 &amp;:&amp; 111359\\ N = 5 &amp;:&amp; 4077\\ N = 6 &amp;:&amp; 18460\\ N = 7 &amp;:&amp; 833\\ N = 8 &amp;:&amp; 1851\\ N = 9 &amp;:&amp; 112\\ N = 10 &amp;:&amp; 121\\ N = 11 &amp;:&amp; 8\\ N = 12 &amp;:&amp; 4\\ N = 13 &amp;:&amp; 1\\ \end{eqnarray} \]</p><p>Obviously, it&#39;s impossible to have just 1 matching birthday because if you have one, then there must be a second (the one that matched it). Interestingly, two pairs is much more likely than three birthdays all matching each other. And having 13 matches is literally (well, approximately) one in a million.</p><p>Since the values after 6 matches are pretty squashed, we can put the y axis on a log scale so that the 493304 value for no matches doesn&#39;t dominate the whole graph.</p><p><img src=/img/n-matching-birthdays-log.7237.png alt="Occurences of N Matching Birthdays in a Group of 23; Log Scale"></p><p>One interesting thing about these graphs is that having 2 matching birthdays is <em>not</em> more likely than having none at all. But at the very beginning we stated in the Birthday Paradox that it&#39;s <em>more</em> likely in a group of 23 to have a match than not to. What gives?</p><p>Well, remember, we said that it was more likely to have <em>at least</em> one match than not to. So really what we should do with this data is to do a <a href=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CumulativeSum.html>cumulative sum</a>.</p><p><img src=/img/n-matching-birthdays-cumsum.6008.png alt="Likelihood of at least N matching birthdays in a group of 23"></p><p>\[ \begin{eqnarray} N &amp;\ge&amp; 0 &amp;:&amp; 100\%\\ N &amp;\ge&amp; 1 &amp;:&amp; 50.6696\%\\ N &amp;\ge&amp; 2 &amp;:&amp; 50.6696\%\\ N &amp;\ge&amp; 3 &amp;:&amp; 14.4142\%\\ N &amp;\ge&amp; 4 &amp;:&amp; 13.6826\%\\ N &amp;\ge&amp; 5 &amp;:&amp; 2.5467\%\\ N &amp;\ge&amp; 6 &amp;:&amp; 2.139\%\\ N &amp;\ge&amp; 7 &amp;:&amp; 0.293\%\\ N &amp;\ge&amp; 8 &amp;:&amp; 0.2097\%\\ N &amp;\ge&amp; 9 &amp;:&amp; 0.0246\%\\ N &amp;\ge&amp; 10 &amp;:&amp; 0.0134\%\\ N &amp;\ge&amp; 11 &amp;:&amp; 0.0013\%\\ N &amp;\ge&amp; 12 &amp;:&amp; 0.0005\%\\ N &amp;\ge&amp; 13 &amp;:&amp; 0.0001\%\\ \end{eqnarray} \]</p><p>So now we&#39;ve come full circle to the original picture of the Birthday Paradox. There&#39;s over a 50% chance that at lease two people&#39;s birthdays will match in a group of 23. Furthermore, there&#39;s a fairly good chance that there will be at least 3 or 4 similar birthdays. And if you had 50 soccer teams, it would be pretty likely that at least one of those teams had at least 6 matching birthdays.</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>This was great fun and all, but is there any practical application of what we&#39;ve seen in this post? Actually, there is a cryptographic attack call the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack>Birthday Attack</a> named for the statistical properties of the Birthday Paradox.</p><p>There are a few differences, of course. The main one being that we&#39;re not looking for matching birthdays (of which, in our simplified example, there are only 365 possibilities), but instead we&#39;re looking for matching outputs of a hash function, which would be a <em>much</em> larger space than just 365 possibilities. But the basic principles are the same, and you know everything you need in order to understand the gist of it.</p><p>Particularly interesting is the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack#Digital_signature_susceptibility>application of this attack on Digital Signatures</a>.</p></div><div class=comments><div id=disqus_thread></div><script type=text/javascript>/* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT BEFORE PASTING INTO YOUR WEBPAGE * * */
